# GraphQL-Node-Mongodb

This is a GraphQL server created with MongoDB and Node.js.  
The actual database URL has been removed for obvious reasons. Before starting the app, add your database URL in src/index.js.

# Start

1. Run `npm i` (or `yarn`) to install all the dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start server.
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql).

### About the project
